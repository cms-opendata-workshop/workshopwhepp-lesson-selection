> ## Prerequisites
>
> Following the [Physics Object Pre-learning](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshopwhepp-lesson-physics-objects/) module is important! You will need the CMSSW docker container and POET analyzer area from that lesson.
> Note: users of the Mac M1/M2 chips will not be able to run the POET examples in this lesson, but can apply the principles to existing POET files
> using the ROOT docker container.
